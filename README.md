## Introduction
LMNote It is a rich text editor written in native code and supports the following functions:

1. Bold, underline, strikethrough
2. Title, subtitle, body format
3. Bullet, ordered list, check box paragraph style
4. Left, centered, right
5. Insert image
6. Draft function
7. Export to HTML

### Problem
Due to the lack of development and maintenance time, only one demo has been developed, which is not well packaged and has some problems (may not be solved in the short term), but the basic functions are complete and support extensions. You can directly get the required ones according to your needs. The code is redeveloped.

**Known issues: **

1. There may be a layout error during the pinyin input process
2. The layout error when the input content contains emoji
3. The input text before and after the picture shows an error.
4. Paste or select all deletes may cause unexpected situations

**Unfinished content: **

1. Italic
2. Export HTML upload image part code
3. Draft storage image optimization
